This project is the Teensy LC code to run a custom usb CH-CombatStick.  v1 is for the older CombatStick where buttons were wired as a single circuit and v2 is for the newer version that utilize a 4x4 button matrix.

Due to patent diffulties, no companies are currently making force feedback joysticks.  The best option is the long discontinued Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback 2.  This modification updates the MSFF2 to have a more modern combat grip and maintain the advantages of force feedback.  The end result appears as two separate sticks (the MSFF2 and a serial USB stick).

Here is the finished build and my dog.
